# Java-Test-Robot-Project-2016
A project to transition the LabVIEW project of 2016 into java.

IN ORDER FOR THE PROJECT TO BUILD CORRECTLY YOU MUST:
-SET THE "navx-mxp", "wpilib", and "networktables" JARs TO THE RIGHT LOCATION ON YOUR COMPUTER
-THE "wpilib" and "netorktables" JARs WILL BE IN YOUR USER DIRECTORY UNDER "wpilib/java/current/lib/" BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE "navx-mxp" LIBRARY!
-THE PROGRAM ALSO USES A JAR FILE ON THE HOST COMPUTER! THE DRIVERSTATION MUST HAVE THIS FILE IN THE RIGHT LOCATION!
